🧠 Model Setup & Project Run Guide
Step 1: Join the Model Files

The model is split into multiple parts inside the models/ folder.
Run the following command in your terminal to combine them into one file:

🪄 For Windows:
copy /b models\best_linear_svm_alexnet_car.part* models\best_linear_svm_alexnet_car.pth

🪄 For Mac/Linux:
cat models/best_linear_svm_alexnet_car.part* > models/best_linear_svm_alexnet_car.pth

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Application
streamlit run ui_code.py


Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

Would you like me to add a one-line project description at the top (e.g., “This project classifies car images using an SVM model trained on AlexNet features”)? It makes it look more polished for submission.
